Procedural Cracks Documentation (Updated 7/20/2019)
------------------------------------------------------

Overview:

Thank you for purchasing my asset!  With Procedural Cracks
you'll be able to add randomized breaking effects to any
surface.  The asset comes with the Cracks shader
that is applied to any cracks object.

Setup:

Apply a material using the Cracks/Cracks shader to an object.

Cracks.shader Properties:
-Inner Color - Sets the upper-side near-the-surface color of the cracks.
-Core Color - Sets the bottom half's color.
-Edge Color - Sets the color of the adjustable edge effect.
-Edge Height - Sets the height of the edge effect.
-Inner Texture (RGB) - Sets the texture of the inside of the cracks
-Mask Texture - Sets the mask that the cracks will render on
-Height Scale - Determines how deep the cracks should sink.
-Parallax Samples - Determines how many steps to render the cracks.  Higher means better quality at the cost of performance.
-Cracks Size - Determines the amount of cracks rendered
-Crack Thickness - Sets the width of the cracks
-Noise Offset - Offsets the noise function
